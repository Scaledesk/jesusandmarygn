I will make myself give up something that my body likes and finds pleasant. I will be austere with myself. Help me to fullfil this promise.</p>

How crushing his sense of failure and his abandonment by his friends!</p>
<strong>Jesus,</strong> <p> I kneel and adore you as they raise up your cross. 'Hail Cross'. Your cross is your standard. I begin to understand what your cross means; it means humiliation, pain, dispossession. You have not even a peaceful place to die in! I will follow your standard. I will proclaim by my life the value you have set on proverty, humiliations and a hard life for the sake of your kingdom.</p>
