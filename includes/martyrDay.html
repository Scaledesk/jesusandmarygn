                                     <strong>  Description:</strong> <span> On the occasion of Martyr's Day, the school celebrated and prayed for the Martyrs who lost their lives and the soldiers who have left their families forever for our safety, guarding us against the enemies. We pray for them & their families. Jesus & Mary Convent School had their students planting a tree in the ground of school & cleaned the school premises and showed their love & gratitude towards the people who scarified their lives for us. In the evening of the day the school prayed by lighting Diya for the Martyrs at 6:00 pm, some of the parents also gave their presence.</span>
