                        <h4>FROM THE PRINCIPAL’S DESK</h4>
                        <p>May I have the joy to thank the parents who have entrusted their loving children to us to form them and build them as responsible, affectionate and creative persons with basic qualities of truthfulness, love and compassion, peace and courage and common brotherhood.
                            Someone asked me that today’s depressing national and international scenario based on money making than man making and learning for living than for life ,what are you going to provide by holding the age old ethical values system. The time has come to change.
                            I would like to tell him and likeminded people why do we give importance to this ethical moral and religious value system because in the present competitive era ,you may notice that the value education has become an odd item. The present educational curriculum gives importance only on academic knowledge and the main aspects of integrated growth of body, mind, spirit is missing so the result is illegal and unfair means are in vogue to get the things done .</p></div>

                </div>
                <p>This sharp fall in ethical and moral values causes a disregard of common man’s interests, the increasing hypocrisy and double talk have caused deterioration and corruption in all walks of life is truly alarming that made Anna Hazare and thousands of people all over India to call for the second freedom struggle. We are sure no law can stop it.</p>
                <p> The degradation of values made man to exploit and accumulate wealth by any means has ruined the basic fabric of the country which has once known for its high values. The high spiritual and moral greatness and performance of duty regarded (Nishkama karma of Gita), hospitality and consideration for fellow men, sympathy and compassion seems to have gone with the great leaders and the wind. Today we face character crisis, and our children have no modals to follow . All are the victims of same phase. Dr. Radhakrishnan pointed out that civilizations are not built with bricks and mortar, steel and machinery they are built with men and women, having high values and character.</p>
                <p>
                    I believe that to save our country our future we need to build the character of our children with the age old value system of love, service, sincerity etc. Therefore I humbly request my teachers and the parents the great role we have to play in the field of education together we cherish the wise principles of the old.
                    If children live with criticism they learn to condemn. If they live with hostility they learn to fight. If they live with ridicule they learn to be shy and if they live with shame they learn to feel guilty but if they live with tolerance they learn to be patient. If they live with encouragement they learn to have confidence.If they live with praise they learn to appreciate if they live with fairness they learn what is justice if they live with security they learn what faith is and if they live with approval they learn to like themselves. If they live with friendship they learn to find love and God.
                    Thus J.M.C.S. stands to inculcate these great principles in the personality formation of our students.
                    I pray and implore we may be able to fulfill this great task by the grace of God almighty and the collaboration and support of each one of us.</p>
                <p>
                    Thanking you,<br>
                    Fr. Sebastian<br>
                    Principal
